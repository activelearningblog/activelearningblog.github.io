The Active Learning Blog is maintained by [Alex Lin](https://sites.google.com/view/alexanderlin), a PhD student in computer science at Harvard University.  The name is a reference to both a [machine learning method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) that I find interesting and an [educational philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning) that I believe in.  On this site, I aim to share recently learned topics that I think are particularly cool within machine learning, data science, mathematical modeling, statistics, optimization, etc.  Hope you enjoy!
